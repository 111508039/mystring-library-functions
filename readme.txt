/* in lib.c and wchar. c files all function definations are there
/* declarations of all functions are in mystring.h and mywchar.h repectively
/* in test.c which is test file for string library each line has format of type (function name, possible inputs, possible output)
/* which are tabs seperated similarly in test1.c which is test file for widechar library each line has 
/* format of type (function name, possible inputs, possibleoutput) which are tabs seperated
/* main.c will and main1.c read from file test.c and test1.c and call a function from lib.c and wchar.c respectively 
/* the output of the function is compared with output read from a file.If output from file matches with 
/* return value of function, then it will print "successful" on the screen, otherwise 
/* it will print "failure" and reason why it failsand also correct output. 
/* project1  and  project2  are the executable files of  string library and widechar library respectively
