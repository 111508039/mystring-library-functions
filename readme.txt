/*string library*/

/* in lib.c file all function definations are there

/* declarations of all functions are in mystring.h

/* in test.c each line has format of type (function name, possible inputs, possible output)

/* main.c will read from file test.c and call a function from lib.c and the output of the 

/* function is compared with output read from a file.If output from file matches with return

/* value of function, then it will print "operation succeed", otherwise it will print "operation failed"

/* and also correct output.
